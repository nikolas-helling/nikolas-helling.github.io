I am a curious and passionate **Robotics Engineer**, recently graduated with honors from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/), where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. Throughout my academic journey, my passion for robotics research has grown, particularly in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). I had the opportunity to explore HRI during my master thesis at [MERLIN Lab](https://merlin.deib.polimi.it/), where I researched and deployed stochastic engines for human behavior prediction in collaborative industrial robotics applications. In addition, I gained hands-on experience in interaction control for humanoid robotics, having partnered with [Oversonic Robotics](https://oversonicrobotics.com/?lang=en) for a semester collaboration. Iâ€™ve also worked on several other mobile robotics projects, developing SLAM, navigation, and control for wheeled robots and drones.

Currently, my research interests range from HRI in humanoid robotics to the application of deep learning techniques for loco-manipulation of legged robots in dynamic and unstructured environments. I am excited to continue exploring these areas as I advance in my research journey, pushing the boundaries of robot intelligence and enhancing their ability to effectively interact with humans and their surroundings.
