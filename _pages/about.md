I am a curious and passionate **Robotics Engineer**, recently graduated with honors from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/), where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. Throughout my academic journey, my passion for robotics research has grown, particularly in the field of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). I had the opportunity to explore HRC during my thesis at [MERLIN Lab](https://merlin.deib.polimi.it/), where I researched and deployed stochastic engines for human behavior prediction in collaborative industrial robotics applications. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in contact control for humanoid robotics, having partnered with [Oversonic Robotics](https://oversonicrobotics.com/?lang=en) for a semester collaboration. Iâ€™ve also worked on several mobile robotics projects, developing SLAM, navigation, and control for wheeled robots and drones.

My research interests span from human-robot interaction in humanoid robotics, to deep learning techniques for loco-manipulation of legged robots. I am excited to continue exploring these areas throughout my research journey, pushing the boundaries of robot intelligence and enhancing their ability to interact with humans and their environments.
